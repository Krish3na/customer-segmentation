## SQL Analytics

The SQL component provides comprehensive business intelligence through four main scripts:

### Database Setup Scripts
- **`setup_database.sql`**: Creates tables and imports synthetic customer data (50,000 customers)
- **`setup_kaggle_database.sql`**: Sets up schema for Kaggle-style e-commerce dataset (500 customers)

### Analysis Scripts
- **`rfm_analysis.sql`**: Comprehensive RFM analysis for synthetic dataset including:
  - Customer demographics analysis (age groups, gender distribution)
  - Transaction patterns and purchase frequency
  - RFM scoring and customer segmentation
  - Revenue analysis by segment
  - Performance metrics and business insights

- **`kaggle_rfm_analysis.sql`**: Specialized analysis for Kaggle dataset featuring:
  - E-commerce specific metrics
  - Product category analysis
  - Customer behavior patterns
  - Optimized queries for smaller dataset performance

### Key SQL Features
- **Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, location analysis with percentage calculations
- **Transaction Patterns**: Purchase frequency, amounts, seasonality analysis
