# Customer Segmentation & Lifetime Value Analysis

A comprehensive customer analytics platform that leverages RFM analysis, machine learning clustering, and predictive modeling to segment customers and forecast lifetime value. Built with Python, SQL, and Streamlit for interactive business intelligence.

## Live Demo

**[Customer Analytics Dashboard](https://customer-segmentation-npdhp866irddywfojzltec.streamlit.app/)**

## Problem Statement

Businesses struggle with understanding customer behavior patterns and predicting future value. Traditional segmentation methods lack precision, and manual analysis doesn't scale. This project addresses these challenges by implementing data-driven customer segmentation and predictive analytics.

## Solution Overview

The platform provides end-to-end customer analytics through:

- **RFM Analysis**: Recency, Frequency, Monetary scoring for customer segmentation
- **Machine Learning Clustering**: K-means clustering with optimal cluster detection
- **LTV Prediction**: Multi-model approach using Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time analytics with dual dataset support
- **SQL Analytics**: Comprehensive business intelligence queries

## Datasets

### Synthetic Dataset (50,000 customers)
- Realistic customer behavior patterns
- Transaction history spanning 2 years
- Demographic information (age, gender, location)
- Purchase amounts and frequencies

### Kaggle-Style Dataset (500 customers)
- E-commerce transaction data
- Product categories and purchase patterns
- Customer demographics and preferences
- Real-world data characteristics

## Technical Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
Raw Data → Data Validation → Feature Engineering → RFM Scoring → Clustering → LTV Prediction → Dashboard
```

### Machine Learning Models
- **Clustering**: K-means with elbow method for optimal clusters
- **LTV Prediction**: 
  - Random Forest (baseline)
  - XGBoost (gradient boosting)
  - LightGBM (light gradient boosting)
  - Linear Regression (interpretability)

### Performance Metrics
- Clustering: Silhouette Score, Inertia Analysis
- LTV Prediction: R² Score, MAE, RMSE
- Business Metrics: Revenue per segment, Customer retention rates
